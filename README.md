### 👋 Hi, I’m @zacharyallen66
I'm a data-driven economist and analytics specialist based in Southern Nevada, currently working at UNLV on research projects for public-sector and economic development clients.

My journey into data began in 2008 building bots and automation scripts using Simba and Pascal, which later evolved into structured analytics during my military service as an all-source intelligence analyst. Through that role, I developed foundational skills in advanced Boolean logic, data structuring, and system-level querying — sharpening my analytical reasoning long before transitioning to formal data science roles.

Since then, I've expanded into Python, R, SQL, STATA, and ArcGIS Pro — combining my economics background with machine learning, spatial analytics, and statistical modeling to deliver actionable insights for governments, universities, and the public good.

-👀  I’m interested in machine learning, spatial analytics, economic intelligence, and decision modeling — especially in domains tied to strategic security, infrastructure, or policy 

🌱 I’m currently exploring LLMs for applied text analysis, time series forecasting, and production-grade Python tooling

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source tools in economic research, civic data platforms, and analytics workflows for impact

🛠️ Languages & Tools: Python (most experienced), R, STATA, SQL, Java, ArcGIS Pro, HTML/CSS, Bash, Simba/Pascal (legacy), and advanced Boolean logic

⚡ Fun fact: I've been tracking markets and developing trading logic since 2010 — these days I channel that into building option analytics tools using live data APIs, Monte Carlo simulations, and risk/volatility modeling. See my options screener powered by Polygon.io.
